Usage Commands:
	Compile:
		To compile: make
		To remove: make clean
	Execution:
		./master <runs with terminationTime = 20, slaveProcesses = 5, maxWrites = 3, outputFile = test.out>
		./master -h <prints help>
		./master -l [string filename] <changes export logfile name>
		./master -s [int x] <spawn x slave processes>
		./master -t [int x] <change termination time limit>

		KNOWN ISSUE: On line 169 of ./oss there is an IF statement. If you change the number 20 to a variable, the entire program breaks.
